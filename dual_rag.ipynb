The impeachment motion passed with support from some members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP), despite a prior boycott of the vote. Thousands of anti-Yoon protesters celebrated outside the National Assembly, highlighting significant public discontent, with polls indicating that three-quarters of South Koreans favored Yoon's removal. Yoon, who has been suspended, declared his intention to fight the impeachment, framing the vote as a temporary setback.

While they have accessed civil service offices, they cannot enter Yoon's main office due to security blockades. Yoon faces multiple investigations for charges of insurrection and treason amid a political crisis, having survived an impeachment vote and growing calls for his resignation. Ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is linked to the martial law declaration, attempted suicide while detained. Many of Yoon's allies have resigned, and political tensions escalate as the ruling party boycotts impeachment proceedings. Meanwhile, the opposition condemns Yoon's agreement to shorten his term as unconstitutional. The situation remains uncertain as 18 investigators seek records related\n",
      "GPT summary:  In South Korea, opposition politicians have initiated impeachment proceedings against President Yoon Suk Yeol following his controversial attempt to impose martial law, marking a significant political crisis as it is the first such attempt since the country's shift to democracy in 1987. Yoon accused the opposition of undermining democracy and collaborating with North Korea. In the U.S., the Supreme Court is set to deliberate a Tennessee law that restricts minors from accessing gender-affirming care, amidst a broader national trend of similar legislation. Meanwhile, in France, Prime Minister Michel Barnier faces a no-confidence vote that could lead to his ousting over a contentious budget proposal.

      "GPT summary:  South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law late Tuesday but quickly rescinded it following protests and parliamentary intervention, leading to calls for his impeachment. Yoon, already weakened by a legislative majority held by the opposition Democratic Party, faces significant political consequences after what many are calling an \"inept semi-coup.\" Experts suggest his presidency is effectively over, with opposition lawmakers prepared to seek impeachment if he does not resign. The martial law declaration has not only worsened Yoon's public image but also rattled financial markets and damaged South Korea's international standing. While the political landscape is polarized, some view the swift public and political pushback against authoritarianism as a sign of South Korea's resilient democracy. The situation reflects deep divisions within\n",

Despite concerns about potential violence and arrest, he took the subway to the assembly, where he found a diverse crowd of protesters, including families and students. The protest remained peaceful, culminating in the assembly's unanimous vote to block the martial law. When President Yoon announced the lifting of martial law, cheers erupted among the demonstrators.

Khalife had been in contact with Iranian agents, providing them information while in the Army. He attempted to pass off false information to MI6, expressing a desire to be a double agent.
